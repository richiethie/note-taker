## Installation

You will need to install express in order to run the back end of this application.

## Usage

Attached below is a screenshot of the home page of this application. The usage is fairly simple. To start typing a new note, the user will click on the plus and then into the note title and create the title, and also click into the note text to create the text of the note. After the note contents are written, a save button will appear in the top right corner. The user can click this button and that will save the note to the left sidebar where the title of that note will be displayed in a list with other saved notes. Finally, a user can also delete any saved notes by clicking on the red garbage can.
